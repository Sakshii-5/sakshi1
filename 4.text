ChatGPT said:
Below is Part-B Question 2 explained step by step, exactly as required for your IA exam (simple + practical).

Part-B – Question 2
Automatically build Java-based website when code is pushed using GitHub Actions

Step 1: Create Java Project (Maven)
Create a folder on your system

java-ci-project
Inside the folder, create a simple Maven project structure:

java-ci-project
 ├── pom.xml
 └── src
     └── main
         └── java
             └── Hello.java
Hello.java

public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Build Successful");
    }
}
pom.xml

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-ci</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>

    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <source>8</source>
                    <target>8</target>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
Step 2: Push Java Project to GitHub
Open GitHub → New Repository

Repository name: java-ci-project

Keep it Public

Click Create Repository

Now push code:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Java project"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/java-ci-project.git
git push -u origin main
✅ Code is now on GitHub

Step 3: Create GitHub Actions Workflow
In your project, create folders:

.github
 └── workflows
     └── maven-build.yml
Step 4: Configure GitHub Actions (Maven Build)
maven-build.yml

name: Java Maven Build

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up JDK
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '8'
        distribution: 'temurin'

    - name: Build with Maven
      run: mvn clean package
Step 5: Push Workflow File
git add .github/workflows/maven-build.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions Maven build"
git push
Step 6: Verify Automatic Build
Go to GitHub Repository

Click Actions tab

You will see Java Maven Build

Green ✔ tick means build successful

✅ Every push triggers automatic Maven build

Expected Outcome (Write in Exam)
Automatic build triggered on code push

Maven build runs using GitHub Actions

Basic CI/CD workflow implemented

Short Exam Conclusion
GitHub Actions is used to automatically build a Java project using Maven whenever code is pushed to the repository, ensuring continuous integration.

If you want, I can also give:

ChatGPT said:
Here’s a short step-by-step version for Part-B Question 2:

Step 1: Create Java Project
Make a simple Maven project with pom.xml and Hello.java

Hello.java prints “Build Successful”

Step 2: Push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <repo-url>
git push -u origin main
Step 3: Add GitHub Actions
Create folder: .github/workflows

Create file: maven-build.yml

Step 4: Configure Workflow
name: Java Maven Build
on: push:
      branches: [main]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '8'
        distribution: 'temurin'
    - run: mvn clean package
Step 5: Push Workflow
git add .github/workflows/maven-build.yml
git commit -m "Add workflow"
git push
Step 6: Check Build
Go to GitHub → Actions tab

Build triggers automatically on every push

Green tick = success ✅

If you want, I can make an even shorter 5-line “exam-ready” answer that you can write in 1 minute. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Step 3 tell me 
ChatGPT said:
Sure! Here’s Step 3 in short:

Step 3: Add GitHub Actions Workflow
Inside your project, create a folder:

.github/workflows
Inside that folder, create a file named:

maven-build.yml
This file will define the automatic build workflow that runs whenever you push code to GitHub.

Basically, Step 3 is just creating the folder and workflow file to tell GitHub Actions what to do.

If you want, I can show exact content for this file next so Step 3 is fully ready. Do you want me to do that?

You said:
In java ci project folder I created pom.xml and index.html.file
ChatGPT said:
Perfect! That’s good for your project setup. 👍

Here’s what you should do next in Step 3 (GitHub Actions workflow) with your current files (pom.xml and index.html):

Step 3: Create GitHub Actions Workflow
Inside your java-ci-project folder, create folders:

.github/workflows
Inside workflows, create a file:

maven-build.yml
Add this content to maven-build.yml (since you have a Maven project and an HTML file for website):

name: Java Maven Build

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '8'
        distribution: 'temurin'

    - name: Build project
      run: mvn clean package
Save the file.

✅ Now, your workflow is ready to automatically build the project whenever you push code.

If you want, I can tell you Step 4: push the workflow to GitHub and verify the build in 2 lines so it’s super short.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Git push -u origin main rejected 
ChatGPT said:
Ah! That happens sometimes. The error “git push -u origin main rejected” usually occurs because your GitHub repo already has some commits (like README) and your local repo history doesn’t match.

Here’s how to fix it step by step:

Option 1: Pull first and push
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git add .
git commit -m "Merge local with remote"
git push -u origin main
Option 2: Force push (use only if no important code is on GitHub)
git push -u origin main --force
✅ This will overwrite GitHub with your local code.

💡 Tip: For a new project, force push is easiest. For a repo with existing work, merge first using Option 1.

If you want, I can give the exact commands for your java-ci-project folder so the push works immediately.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
Tell me step by step from first
ChatGPT said:
Perfect! Let’s do complete step-by-step instructions from the very beginning for your Java CI Project including GitHub push and workflow setup. I’ll make it short and exam-friendly, so you can follow easily.

Step 1: Create Project Folder
Make a folder on your system:

java-ci-project
Inside the folder, create your files:

pom.xml (for Maven build)

index.html (your website page)

Example pom.xml for simple Java project:

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0">
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-ci</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.8.1</version>
                <configuration>
                    <source>8</source>
                    <target>8</target>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
</project>
Step 2: Initialize Git and Commit
Open terminal/cmd inside java-ci-project folder.

Run:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Step 3: Connect to GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub → New Repository → name: java-ci-project

Do not add README (to avoid conflicts).

Copy repo URL:

https://github.com/USERNAME/java-ci-project.git
Connect local repo to GitHub:

git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/java-ci-project.git
Step 4: Push to GitHub
If GitHub is empty:

git push -u origin main
If rejected (repo has commits like README):

git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git add .
git commit -m "Merge local and remote"
git push -u origin main
Step 5: Add GitHub Actions Workflow
Inside java-ci-project create folders:

.github/workflows
Inside workflows, create maven-build.yml with content:

name: Java Maven Build

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Set up Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:
        java-version: '8'
        distribution: 'temurin'

    - name: Build project
      run: mvn clean package
Step 6: Push Workflow File
git add .github/workflows/maven-build.yml
git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow"
git push
Step 7: Verify Build
Go to GitHub → Actions tab

Click on the workflow Java Maven Build

If you see green tick ✅, build is successful

✅ Now your project is set up for automatic build whenever you push code.

If you want, I can make a super short 5-line “exam answer version” from this so you can just write it in the exam.

Do you want me to do that?
